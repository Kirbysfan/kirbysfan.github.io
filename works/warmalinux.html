            <h2>Warma Linux</h2>
            <p>
                A fan made Warma (A very cute and famous Bilibili user) themed system.<br>
                Ver.1 was based on Xubuntu 16.04, while Ver.2 was based on Linux Mint 18.3<br>
                Since this is mainly for China so you'll see a lot of Chinese software.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the January of 2020, I was staying at home because of the epidemic,<br>
                and just at that time, I discovered Warma. Because of her cuteness, she<br>
                sooner became my favourite person. I also entered a QQ group full of Warma fans.<br>
                A few days later, I saw someone in the group made a Warma themed system based on Windows 10,<br>
                this aroused my curiosity, I started wondering if I can make a Warma themed Linux...<br>
                And because of that, I started making Warma Linux, with almost no experience distributing Linux.<br>
                This is my very first work that was related to Computer, which made me become more and more interested<br>
                to programming and many other IT related things.
