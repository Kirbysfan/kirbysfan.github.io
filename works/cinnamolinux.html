            <h2>CinnamoLinux</h2>
            <p>
                A fan made Cinnamoroll (One of the mascot of Sanrio) themed<br> 
                Linux system based on Xubuntu (16.04 for Ver1, 18.04 for Ver.2)<br>
                Since this is mainly for China so you'll see a lot of Chinese software.<br>
                Cinnamoroll is owned by Sanrio. Co. Ltd (Japan)
            </p>
            <p>
                A few days after I made Warma Linux Ver.1, I became obsessed with Cinnamoroll from Sanrio.<br>
                His cuteness completely made me fall in love. And he sooner became one of my favourite character.<br>
                My crush on him sooner led to my idea of making a Cinnamoroll themed Linux. And that is it, CinnamoLinux.
