This is my personal website! Here you can see what's inside here!<br>
Actually I'm making this website directly using what I had learnt. And it was written directly using notepad++.<br>
This is just a brief html file at this moment. But it will be improved and finalized as I make progress in Web development. (Of course, Python is still my main)
